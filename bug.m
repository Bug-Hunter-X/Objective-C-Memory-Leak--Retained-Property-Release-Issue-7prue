In Objective-C, a rare but impactful bug can arise from the misuse of the `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` methods in manual reference counting (MRC).  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

// ...in some other method...
MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
obj.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString: @"Hello"];
[obj release]; //This is the problem! 

```

The issue lies in releasing `obj` before releasing `myString`. Because `myString` is retained by `obj`, releasing `obj` doesn't release `myString`, leading to a memory leak.  Furthermore, if this code is part of a larger application with complex memory management, tracking down this type of error can be difficult because it doesn't crash immediately. The leak only becomes apparent over time.
